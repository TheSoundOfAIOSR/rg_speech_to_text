Tone, in acoustics, sound that can be recognized by its regularity of vibration. 
A simple tone has only one frequency, although its intensity may vary. 
A complex tone consists of two or more simple tones, called overtones. 
The tone of lowest frequency is called the fundamental the others, overtones. 
The frequencies of the overtones may be whole multiples. 
A combination of harmonic tones is pleasant to hear and is therefore called a musical tone.
